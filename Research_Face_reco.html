                                <p><b>Abstract</b></p>
								<p>The selection of a good leader plays a major role in the development and sustainability of a
                                    country economic growth. The means by which these leaders are selected should be free from
                                    various malpractices by enabling a reliable system that ensure accountability and transparent
                                    electoral process. The earliest system adopted posed great threat to the security of life and
                                    properties of the voters which led to the introduction of the secret ballot system in which
                                    accreditation and authentication are done by means of sighting. While this system was
                                    considered as a good replacement of the open ballot system yet it gives room for various electoral
                                    malpractices. This brought about the introduction of electronic voting by the use of smart card
                                    reader for accreditation and authentication, but this system failure to authenticate eligible voters
                                    in several cases lead to the proposal for the integration of computer vision technology with the
                                    existing system. The underlying demographics of datasets used to train face verification models
                                    are frequently insufficient to account for the huge range of facial traits found in people all over
                                    the world. To mitigate these limitations, we design a model based on the popular VGG
                                    architecture and a dataset rich enough to represent the geographical diversity of people across
                                    the world and introduced the just published FaVCI2D dataset for evaluation of the model. which
                                    was then deployed for authentication of voters for use in the electoral process using an Android
                                    application system. The bulk of reported biases are attributable to the use of demographically
                                    unbalanced training data in the creation of face recognition algorithms. We were able to improve
                                    performance of face verification model using dataset of suitable technical design as stated by
                                    (Popescu et al, 2021).</p>
								<p><b>Methodology</b></p>
                                <p>The implementation for this thesis was obtained from (Simonyan, 2015) but contains a number
                                    of significant modifications ranging from datasets to model architecture and mode of operation
                                    of our android application. (Popescu et al, 2021) proposed a sound design of face recognition or
                                    verification datasets which was ensured was incorporated in the implementation of this study.
                                    The number of our unique identities and total number of images for training our face recognition
                                    models was large enough to represents the general population, Also, a balanced demographic
                                    factor such as gender and geographic origin were also put in consideration and we introduced a
                                    challenging genuine and imposter pairs of images for evaluation of our model.</p>

                                 <p><b>Conclusion</b></p>
                                    The current performance of face verification provides an illusion that the task has been
                                    effectively solved, however (Popescu et al, 2021) argues that existing datasets were constructed
                                    utilizing two oversimplifying design decisions. In practice, verification is required to detect
                                    challenging imposters, thus the standard identity selection from impostor pairs is insufficient.
                                    Furthermore, existing demographic datasets are insufficient to depict the great range of facial
                                    traits found in people all across the world. In this study, a functional model based on the VGG
                                    Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was designed and trained with dataset of sound technical
                                    characteristics suitable for training face verification models as proposed by (Popescu et al, 2021),
                                    and its performance was verified using the recently published FaVCI2D dataset.
                                    We offer some fascinating insights into the processes that must be taken in order to create a fair
                                    face verification process. The bulk of reported biases are attributable to the use of
                                    demographically unbalanced training data in the creation of face recognition algorithms. We
                                    were able to improve performance of face verification model using dataset of suitable technical
                                    design stated by (Popescu et al, 2021).
